            <p>Welcome to YouRe. This Privacy Policy explains how YGY LABS ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application ("Service").</p>

                <li><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong> This includes information you provide when you create an account, such as your email address and password.

                <li><strong>Information from Third Parties:</strong> If you sign in through a third-party service (like Apple or Google), we receive information from that service, such as your basic profile information. We also use third-party services for payment processing (like the App Store), and while we don't receive your full payment details, we get confirmation of your purchases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

                <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our Service.</li>
                <li>Create and manage your account and synchronize your data across devices.</li>
